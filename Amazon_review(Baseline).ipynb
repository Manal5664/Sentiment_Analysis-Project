No matter which version, it's easy to use easy to install and very handy and helpful to have. I don't fax often but when I do I know I can rely on Winfax 10.0 to perform exactly as stated. And you don't need a manual or book to learn how to use it. The manual and instructions included in the program is all you really need.I would like to add this statement from a previous or what another reviewer wrote: \"Amazon states that 10.0 will work with Windows XP. Version 10.02 is required according to Symantec's own website.\"My search shows not only does Amazon state 10.0 will work with windows xp, Symentec's own web site states the same thing. No where did I find that Symentec's website stated Version 10.02 is required for Windows XP. People do your own search in addition do to reading these reviews.\n"
